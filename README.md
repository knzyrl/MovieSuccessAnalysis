# STA302 Final Project: Analyzing Movie Revenue  

## Overview  
This project explores **what factors contribute to a movieâ€™s financial success and popularity** using the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**.  
We use **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** to analyze how predictors such as **budget**, **runtime**, **release year**, and **genre** influence  **revenue**. 
By applying transformations and residual diagnostics, the analysis examines how production and creative characteristics shape movie performance.


## Research Question
